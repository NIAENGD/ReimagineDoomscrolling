# ReimagineDoomscrolling

A concept for curating high-quality YouTube content.

This repository contains notes and design documents for a proposed browser extension and local helper server. The goal is to automatically fetch videos from a user's feed, analyse transcripts with language models and present rewritten articles for distraction-free reading.

See [docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md) for the current high level design, including the strict scoring rubric used when analysing each transcript.

## Quick start

Install dependencies and run the helper server. It only provides a local endpoint for Whisper transcription so no API keys are required:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

Windows users can run `run_app.bat` for a small menu that installs
dependencies or launches the server.

The server exposes a small API for fetching subtitles and running Whisper when
needed. The Chrome extension in the `extension/` folder handles scoring and the
results page internally. Load the folder as an unpacked extension and use the
popup to start collecting links. Each link is sent to the server only when a
transcript is required.

The popup now lets you customise the scoring and rewriting prompts. Choose the
desired ChatGPT model manually within the ChatGPT tabâ€”the extension simply sends
your prompts to whatever model is active.
Before starting, ensure you are logged into both sites. The popup checks for cookies and refuses to run if either account is missing.
Once processing completes the extension automatically closes the hidden YouTube and ChatGPT tabs.
